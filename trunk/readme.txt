Makes plugin admin icons follow WordPress guidelines: Monochrome by default, color when active or moused-over.

== Description ==

Many plugins only provide a color icon for the WordPress admin menu. This makes the user interface inconsistent and sometimes confusing because built-in menu icons are monochrome by default, and only use color to show that menu is active or moused-over.

The [WordPress guidelines for admin icons](http://dotorgstyleguide.wordpress.com/outline/icons/) were pointed out to us by [Helen Hou Sandi's](http://helenhousandi.com/) great [WordPress UI presentation](http://slides.helenhousandi.com/wcphx2012.html#9) at WordCamp Phoenix 2012.

This plugin makes all admin icons behave the same, whether correct icons were provided or not. It supports all major browsers, including: Internet Explorer 7+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari, and Chrome.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `monochrome-admin-icons` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. **Before** Plugin icons are color, default icons are monochrome. **After** Plugin icons match default icon behavior: color only when active or hovered over.
