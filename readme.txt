Make third-party admin icons use color only when active or moused-over, like default WordPress icons.

== Description ==

Many plugins only provide a color icon for the WordPress admin menu. This makes the user interface inconsistent and sometimes confusing because built-in menu icons only use color when a menu is active or moused-over.

This plugin makes all admin icons behave the same, whether correct icons are provided or not. It supports all major browsers, including:
	
* Internet Explorer 7+
* Firefox 3.5+
* Safari 5+
* Chrome 17+

The [WordPress guidelines for admin icons](http://dotorgstyleguide.wordpress.com/outline/icons/) were pointed out to by [Helen Hou Sandi's](http://helenhousandi.com/) great [WordPress UI presentation](http://slides.helenhousandi.com/wcphx2012.html#9) at WordCamp Phoenix 2012.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `monochrome-admin-icons` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. **Before** Plugin icons are color, default icons are monochrome. **After** Plugin icons match default icon behavior: color only when active or hovered over.
